    <p>What is ancient Greek Philosophy and how has the impact of the ancient Greeks' famous thinkers affected our outlook on modern life? The greeks who made a name for themselves through philosophy include but are not limited to figures such as Aristotle, Socrates, Epicurus, Plato, Diogenes and one of my favorite Epictetus.</p>

    <p>One area that Epictetus excelled in, in the many areas of philosophy is Stoicism, which can be essentially dumbed down to the art of not being affected by what cannot be controlled by oneself. For example, one may have a loved one in their family pass away, this is an uncontrollable thing and the nature of life. Epictetus tells us to not let this destroy us internally emotionally as it would hurt someone very deeply. We learn from him to not be upset over what cannot be controlled and to control our reactions such as how we act in accordance to sad news as such. Many think that Stoicism is the art of “not feeling” which couldn't be more wrong. It is a way of life that lets one be free from what they cannot control, it lets one recognize what they can or cannot do in order to be better for themselves or others in any accordance. </p>
